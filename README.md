# Project Name??
# Project Description: 
Our project plot was the following: A group of students are working on their Comm Lab audio assignment when they are suddenly interrupted by a fire alarm. They decide to ignore the alarm, assuming it's just a drill, and continue working on their assignment. As soon as Jun catches on that they could be in real danger, it's already too late. Panic overwhelms them as they find Jun fainted on the ground from the excess of smoke, which ultimately leads everyone surrounding him in the hospital, awaiting his awakening. 

We did not create this story to have a distinct story structure. We aimed for our project to feel like a story unravelling in real time, where the listener is also experiencing the suspense alongside us. As much as we wanted to create an intense, anxiety inducing experience, we also tried to incorporate bits of comic relief through exaggerated audio pieces and through Abdullahâ€™s character by poking fun at Jun and his work effort.

As for the site, we went with a minimalistic approach as it was primarily a sound project. We used simple shapes moving up the screen and simple solid backgrounds. The shapes and colors were used to reflect the emotional state of the characters. As it got more intense, the colors changes from a calming blue to a bright red to denote the intensity of the moment. The shapes also changes from squares to triangles as the fire starts to become serious. The frequency of the shapes appearing also changes as the story progresses, and they become more frequent and chaotic as the situation got worse.

# Process: 
We came up with this idea for our project to be about us doing our project as we were in the library cafe working on our project. Instead of renting out camera equipment, our process revolved around using the app Lexis to record and save our audio. We recorded the sounds of our voices, door shutting, chairs moving, and the rest was taken from online sources. When it came down to the editing process, we tried to make the beginning sound as realistic as possible, using ambient sounds to convey a natural setting in the library cafe. As the piece went on, we incorporated more dramatic sounds to demonstrate where suspense was supposed to be built up. We also partially did this for comedic effect, the exaggerated-ness of some of the sounds was purposeful in pushing this concept forward. 

The site was coded using JQuery. As we only used simple shapes, we didn't need to use any big external libraries, and we were able to draw the shapes using HTML Canvas.

# Reflection:
 Overall, the process of doing this project was an enjoyable one but it did come with its challenges. None of us had worked with audacity before, so I think our main goal was simply to produce something that was cohesive and incited emotions within a listener. 
We had issues accessing proper audio equipment which definitely impeded our process as we weren't able to produce the highest quality audio. This also made it harder to edit in audacity with varying levels of sound quality. In terms of expectations, I think we found it more challenging than expected with a few bumps along the way, but overall we tried our best with our limited time and feel like we executed our goal.
